Here you may find the instructions on how to set up the environment


The "machine" is the "local machine" on Replit (https://replit.com) where a Repl is created
The below info is pertaining to installment on Replit, for more info see https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install

1. Make sure that you have Python installed
    To verify, open shell and type "python" - that should give you the Python version

2. Use virtual environment to separate Qiskit from other applications (in this example, the environment name is "qickig-env", you may chose your own)
    python -m venv qiskit-env    #install the virtual environment
    source qiskit-env/bin/activate  #activate your virtual environment

3. Use the Jupyter development environment to interact with Qiskit
    pip install jupyterlab  #installing the JyputerLab
    # Make sure that you have exited the virtual environment with "exit" before installing, otherwise you will get "ERROR: Can not perform a '--user' install. User site-packages are not visible in this virtualenv."
    jupyter lab  #launching the JupyterLab
